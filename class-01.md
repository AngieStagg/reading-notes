## Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

The browser analyzes an HTML file and looks for a link for CSS or a script for JavaScript.  If it finds those, it then explores those as well. The browser then creates an in-memory DOM tree from the HTML, CSSOM structure from the CSS, and compiles and executes JavaScript.  From these, an interactive web page is created.

## How can you find images to add to a Website?

First, you should use Google’s license filter and select the creative commons licenses to avoid trouble.  Next, enter your search terms to find something suitable.
