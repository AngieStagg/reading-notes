# Local Storage

## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
Local storage allows developers to store and retrieve data in the browser. The data stored in local storage will not expire even if the tab or the browser window is closed.

## What information should not be stored in local storage?
Local storage should never be used for sensitive information such as passwords or personal information.

## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
Local storage allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date.
To correctly store JavaScript objects in LocalStorage, we first need to convert our object to a JSON string.
