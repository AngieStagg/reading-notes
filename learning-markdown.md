Let’s say you wanted to format a page but didn’t know HTML.  How will you make certain words **bold** or others *italicized*?  How can you change the size of titles without learning a new language? Welcome to Markdown, sure it is a kind of language to learn, but it would be better described as a set of rules to follow, and they’re pretty simple.  You may not be able to do everything a web developer could, but you can do a lot of the most popular things they can.


You want to make a heading large? It’s as simple as adding a hashtag in front of your title. #Title 
# Title
Want to go smaller? Add more hashtags. ###### Title  You can add up to six for the smallest, larger font. 
###### Title

Want to add bold text?  Just add two asterisks before and after your desired text.  `**Bold**` **Bold**

Want it italicized?  Just add one asterisk.  `*Bold*`  *Bold*

Want to add a list?  In HTML it’s pretty complicated.  Markdown is pretty straightforward.  Just add a number one followed by a period, and so forth...

1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

So you see, you don’t have to be a coding whiz to dress up your text.  Learning the simple markdown syntax is an easy and labor-saving alternative to other markup languages.
