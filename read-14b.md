# What Google Learned About Teams -14b

This was an interesting article on team dynamics.  Funny that a study group didn’t mesh well, but a code challenge group did.  I would think a shared goal, as opposed to competition within the group, was the cause of that.

Another interesting take was that the individual IQs didn’t matter that much.  Whether their scores were all within the same range or varied wasn’t really a factor.  I like how it was more about the overall group IQ.  How the individual abilities meshed together to reach goals.  

I think the dynamic of people caring about one another and mutual respect and kindness goes a long way.  Inclusivity and making sure everyone has a voice are very important.  It’s no wonder that the groups who valued these were the ones that achieved success.

And, what about Matt Sakaguchi?  What an interesting and amazing man.  A SWAT officer that really doesn’t have a technical background, but leads a tech team.  Has terminal cancer, but still works because his work is that important.  I love his grateful nature and engineering spirit.  

Great article!
