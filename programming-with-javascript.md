# Programming with JavaScript

## MDN Control Flow
Computers execute statements in a script in an order called The Control Flow.  This order runs from the first to the last line in a file, unless it comes across structures that change its flow.  These structures can be conditionals and loops.

## Functions
Functions are awesome because you can reuse code.  Input different arguments and get different results.  

To make a function, simply use this example:

function name(a,b) {
	return a + b
}

This simple function begins with the “function” keyword, then a space, and then a “name.”  You can make the name whatever you choose.  Inside the parenthesis, you can include parameter names.  Make sure to separate these with commas.  In the second line, between the curly brackets, you can place the code you want to be executed.  


## Expressions and Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators:
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Arithmetic operators
Bitwise operators
Logical operators
String operators
Conditional (ternary) operator
Comma operator
Unary operators
Relational operators
An expression is a block of code that evaluates to a value. A statement is any block of code that is performing some action. The difference between an expression and a statement is important because an expression is a subset of a statement.
