# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Explain why we need domain modeling.
A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem. As a communication tool, it can reach both technical and layman teams.

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
Tables shouldn't be used for page layouts because they are slow to render as the browser needs to download most, if not all, of the table to render it properly. They require more bandwidth usage.

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
`<table>`  encloses the content of a table
`<td>`	      table cell
`<tr>`         table row

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. It is useful when you want to create multiple similar objects with the same properties and methods.

### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
In an object literal it is just a reference to the current object and isnâ€™t of much value.  However, in a constructor, it saves you from having to change out each instance.

### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
In the last lab, we had to add details to an object, like minimum and maximum customers, and average cookie sales.
