# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML

### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? 
`<a>`

### The href attribute contains what information?
The href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, contains the web address.

### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
Use can use concise and meaningful text for links, avoid using URLs for link text, and do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.


## CSS Layout

### What is meant by “normal flow”?
Normal flow is the way that webpage elements naturally lay themselves out.

### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go, begin on new lines, and have top and bottom margins.  Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element, can start anywhere in a line, and don’t have top and bottom margins.

### ___ positioning is the default for every HTML element.
static


### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
A few advantages are good cross-browser support, less dependence on floats, which can be problematic, and less dependence on margins.


### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
Absolute positioning is relative to its containing block,  whereas the position and dimensions of an element with fixed positioning are always relative to the initial containing block.



## Learn JS

### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
Declaration declares the creation of variables and functions. Invocation executes a piece of code.


### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.


## Miscellaneous

### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

1. The biggest benefit, I have found, is the second pair of eyes.
2. If one doesn’t know something, then perhaps the other does.  If both don’t, you have two people searching for the answer instead of just one.
