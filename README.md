## A growth mindset is taking charge of your learning adventure.  Persistence, through challenges, will result in understanding and success. ##



**How I Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset:**

- When I get overwhelmed, I will take a break or a nap
- If one way to reach a goal isn't working, I'll find another
