# Readings: Images, Color, Text


## HTML 

### What is a real-world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
The alt attribute provides alternative data.  Withing an `<img>` tag it provides a description of the photo for those with visual impairments or if the link is broken.  

### How can you improve the accessibility of images in an HTML document?
You can improve accessibility by not using text in images, and utilizing the alt attribute to describe the picture.

### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
You can wrap `<img>` and `<figcaption>` elements in a `<figure>` element to mark-up the image and its description.  

### Describe the difference between a gif image and a .svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
A .gif is not resolution-independent and will look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions. SVG is scalable and resolution-independent and will look good on any screen resolution.

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
JPG is a good choice, but the preferred would be a WebP first, and a JPG as a backup.


## CSS

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
The foreground color is the color of the text, lines, and punctuation.  Basically, it’s the color of what you type.  The background color is the color behind this.  

### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch-up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
This would all depend on the website and his preferences.  It could be a fun, hip website and use bright, funky colors to convey this better.  However, it could be a formal law website where earth tones or monotone would work better.  It all depends.

### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
You should consider if a font is safe to use across all platforms, is readable, and does it fit with what you’re trying to convey.  Next, be sure to limit your fonts to two or three, and those should contrast one another.  


### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
Font-size is pretty self-explanatory, font-weight is the boldness, and font-style is normal, italic, or oblique styling.

### Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
The letter-spacing and word-spacing properties allow you to set the spacing between letters and words in your text.
