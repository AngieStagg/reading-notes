# Structure Web Pages With HTML

### Wireframing
A wireframe is basically the skeleton of web pages.  To build a wireframe, you must first have a clear understanding of what you’re doing.  What is the purpose of this website?  What do we want the future users to take away from the site?  How will the future users navigate the site?

Once we understand that, we can decide whether we want to start sketching with paper or pen or with software (UXPin, inVision, Wireframe.cc).  Start out with a rough sketch, and play around with it till it’s right and the flow is good.  Then you will make a prototype.  This will be your final blueprint to begin coding.

### HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  HyperText are links that connect web pages to eachother.  Markup is just what it sounds like, it marks up text in a way that the computer understands what it is.  Therefore, HTML is code that structures web pages.  It consists of elements that wrap around selected content to make it appear or behave in a certain way.  Tags, there is almost always an opening and closing one, are the bread in a content sandwich.  

Next, there are attributes.  These add extra information to the tags.  Such as font size, color, or even to mark this particular element for special styling in CSS.  You can nest tags inside your sandwich too.  This can help to bold a word in the midst of a paragraph.  Some tags are self-closing.  Those you’ll need to memorize.

### Semantics
Semantics, in a programming sense, is the way that data and commands are presented.  Semantics, in summary, is concerned with logical outcomes.  Its purpose and practice is to make language understandable to humans and to machines.
