# Readings: Debugging


## Troubleshooting JavaScript

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors are basically just typos.  Logic errors are correct, but they don’t produce the intended result due to broken logic.  

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Again and again, I have encountered syntax errors mainly in forgetting the semicolon at the end of a line of code, or typos. This just requires a second or third look with some help from the error tools.  Easy enough.  As far as logic errors, this has been my long, too long history with trying to create the table in Javascript.  I still haven’t solved it, but hoping to soon.  I have to.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long-term goals?
Being that my goal revolves around starting a new career in software development, and employers want clean, bug-free code, I would think it would influence it quite a bit.


## The JavaScript Debugger

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The debugger is basically like any other tool, in that it helps you fix a specific type of problem.  In this case, it helps to identify coding issues at various stages of the coding process.  

### Define what a breakpoint is.
A breakpoint is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.

### What is the call stack?
The call stack is a list of all the active functions that have been called to get to the current point of execution. The call stack includes an entry for each function called, as well as which line of code will be returned to when the function returns.
