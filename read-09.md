# Forms and JS Events

## HTML Forms
### **Why are forms so important in web development?**

Forms are how you collect data from users.  For businesses, these are your customers.  This is information directly from your bread and butter.  Also, you can gauge how well your website is engaging your consumer by their participation.

### **When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**

You want to make it simple and easy.  Use auto-correct and auto-fill, clear and obvious action buttons, inline field labels, and error messages, and make sure to have a mobile-friendly version.

### **List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**

- The `<input>` tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.
- The `<select>` element is used to create a drop-down list. It is most often used in forms to collect user input.
- The `check-box` is a square box that is ticked (checked) when activated.
- The `radio button` is a form element that allows the user to select one option from a range of options.
- The `submit button` submits all form values to a form-handler.


## Learn JavaScript - Introduction to Events

### **How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?**

Events are something happening with a webpage.  It could be a click or the movement of a mouse.  It could be a page reloading.  It could be scrolling.  Pretty much any action.

### **When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?** 

You will need to provide the name of the event and a function to handle the event.

### **Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**

When someone interacts with a web browser, the browser creates an event object which has properties that describe the interaction.  The event object goes through all the elements that could have been triggered until it finds the “target”.  This is the element that was clicked. 

### **What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?**

Event capturing is when the event object goes to find the target.  Event bubbling is when the object returns.
